This is a series of at least two posts where the first one [Creating a Resource for Services 3.x](services-3.x-sample/blob/master/creating-a-service-pt1.markdown) goes into how you can create a resource for services. The second one will detail how you set up OAuth with services, and how you can connect to other Drupal installations using the rest_client module.
